<h2>When will you be contacted</h2>
  <p>Contacts &amp; Agency Contacts will be notified when a social media account or mobile app has been in the system
  for 6 months without changes to ensure data stays fresh</p>
  <p>If data looks like it may no longer to be correct, an admin will mark an item as "under review".  This does not mean its status as public/archvied has been changed, just that we'd like you to take a look at it.  If its been under review for more than 2 weeks, it may be archived.</p>
<h2>Explain Statuses</h2>
  <p>Submitted, Public, Archived</p>
  <p>Items can also be deleted by the system, typically if they have been archived or adhoc by an administrator if deemed necessary</p>
